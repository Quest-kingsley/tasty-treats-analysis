# 🥐 Tasty Treats Bakery Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This is my first Data Analytics project, where I analyzed sales data from a fictional bakery called **Tasty Treats Bakery**.

The goal of this project was to explore sales performance across product categories and generate insights that could support business decision-making.

This project demonstrates my skills in:

* SQL querying
* Data cleaning
* Data aggregation
* Data visualization (Tableau)
* Analytical thinking

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

As this was my first analytics project, I encountered several challenges:

### 1️⃣ SQL Syntax Errors

I struggled with:

* Incorrect query structure
* Misplaced commas
* Improper use of `GROUP BY`
* Forgetting required clauses

### 2️⃣ Knowing the Appropriate Commands

At times, I was unsure:

* When to use `GROUP BY`
* When to use `ORDER BY`
* How to properly use aggregate functions like `SUM()`
* How to structure queries to get the exact required output

### 3️⃣ Debugging Queries

Some queries did not return the expected results, and I had to carefully:

* Re-read the error messages
* Break down the query into smaller parts
* Test different approaches

## 💡 How I Surmounted the Challenges

I overcame these challenges by:

* Doing additional research on SQL documentation
* Watching tutorials to better understand query structure
* Practicing writing multiple versions of the same query
* Reading error messages more carefully instead of ignoring them
* Reviewing examples of similar SQL problems

Through consistent practice and research, I improved my understanding of SQL syntax and query logic.

## 📈 What I Learned

* The importance of clean and structured queries
* How aggregation works in SQL
* How to transform raw data into meaningful insights
* The value of persistence when debugging errors
* How visualization enhances data storytelling

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add time-based analysis (monthly/weekly trends)
* Perform profit analysis (not just revenue)
* Build a more interactive Tableau dashboard
* Incorporate advanced SQL concepts like subqueries and joins
